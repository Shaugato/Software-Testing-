I got this program from GitHub. It can be found at:

https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/data_structures/binary_tree/binary_search_tree_recursive.py


Program saves as : binary_search_tree_recursive.py ( this is the original program )

Program Basic info:

This is a python3 implementation of binary search tree using recursion

All the mutants list are in the "MUTANTS" forlder.

I have written test cases for Metaphofic Relations 1 and Metaphofic Relation 2 in "test_binary_search_tree.py" here. 

I haver written 30 mutants for my original program. The I write Test cases for both MR1 and MR2 for each Mutants.

For example : M1_binary_search_tree_recursive.py has two test cases which are Mutant1_MR1_Testing.py (MR1 testing) and Mutant1_MR2_Testing.py(MR2 testing) 
In this was I have write two test cases for each mutant , in total 60 test cases for 30 mutants

All the test cases are placed in TEST folder
