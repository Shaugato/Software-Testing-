# Mutation Testing for Binary Search Tree

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth exploration of mutation testing applied to a Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation. The goal of this project is to evaluate the robustness of the BST through systematically generated mutants, and test these using both dynamic and static testing techniques. The repository is organized into several key components, as follows:

- **Dynamic and Static Testing**: Contains all the tests used to verify the mutants and evaluate the mutation scores.
- **Mutant Creation**: Contains the mutants generated by introducing specific changes to the original source code.
- **Program Under Test**: Contains the original Binary Search Tree implementation.

### Components

#### Dynamic and Static Testing
This folder contains all the test scripts used to evaluate the mutants. These tests are designed to cover different aspects of the BST functionality, including:

- **Insertion Validation**: Tests if nodes are inserted correctly, maintaining the properties of a Binary Search Tree.
- **Deletion and Reassignment**: Tests the deletion of nodes under various conditions, ensuring reassignment of child nodes preserves tree integrity.
- **Traversal Checks**: Performs in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals to validate the structure of the tree.
- **Existence Checks**: Verifies the presence of nodes to ensure search functionality is accurate.

The testing is done using two main metamorphic relations:
- **MR1**: Evaluates insertion operations, existence checks, and in-order traversal properties of the BST.
- **MR2**: Focuses on node deletion, reassignment, and maintaining tree properties.

#### Mutant Creation
The mutants in this folder were generated by making deliberate changes to the original BST implementation, such as:

- **Comparison Changes**: Changing comparison operators (`<` to `>=`, `>` to `<=`) to test the robustness of comparison logic.
- **Logic Changes**: Modifying reassignment logic during insertion or deletion to see if these changes are detected.
- **Traversal Changes**: Replacing traversal methods (e.g., in-order to pre-order) or modifying the order of yielding nodes.

A total of **30 mutants** were generated, each targeting a different aspect of the BST logic. Mutants that do not alter the functional behavior of the tree were classified as equivalent.

#### Program Under Test
This folder contains the original implementation of the **Binary Search Tree**. The BST is implemented using a recursive approach, featuring the following operations:

- **Insertion (`put`)**: Adds a new node to the BST.
- **Search (`search`)**: Finds a node by its value.
- **Deletion (`remove`)**: Removes a specified node from the BST, with appropriate reassignment to maintain the tree properties.
- **Traversal (`inorder_traversal`, `preorder_traversal`)**: Provides different types of traversal outputs for the tree.

## Mutation Testing Results
### Effectiveness of MR1
- **Detection Rate**: MR1 successfully identified issues in **25 out of 30** mutants, resulting in an **83.33% detection rate**.
- **Strengths**: MR1 was effective in catching mutants involving changes in comparison operators, insertion logic, and traversal order.

### Effectiveness of MR2
- **Detection Rate**: MR2 identified faults in **24 out of 30** mutants, resulting in an **80% detection rate**.
- **Strengths**: MR2 excelled in detecting incorrect node deletions and reassignment issues that affected the structure of the BST.

### Combined Effectiveness
- Together, MR1 and MR2 were able to detect **28 out of 30** mutants, resulting in a combined effectiveness of **93%**.
- This indicates the strength of using complementary metamorphic relations to thoroughly evaluate the system.

## Usage
### Running the Tests
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/binary-search-tree-mutation-testing.git
   cd binary-search-tree-mutation-testing
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the tests in the `Dynamic_And_Static_Testing` folder:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover Dynamic_And_Static_Testing
   ```

### Generating Mutation Scores
To evaluate the effectiveness of MR1 and MR2:
- Run the test suite for each mutant to determine if the introduced change is detected.
- Record the outcomes to calculate the mutation score.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of mutation testing in assessing the robustness of software systems. By applying **metamorphic testing** and **mutation analysis**, we were able to identify weaknesses in the Binary Search Tree implementation and improve the reliability of its operations.
